How to view:

With https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2 installed and running the data server on port 1337:

1. run yarn or npm install to install required dependency nodes

2. run 'gulp sync' which will create a 'dist' folder, serve it on localhost:8000, and open your browser to the page


Special thanks to Alexandro Perez' walk through which I leaned heavily upon to set up gulp, troubleshoot my indexedDb, etc.
